sfSmart3ViewPlugin
==================
This plugin integrates smarty 3 ([www.smarty.net][smartylink]) as a configurable view
layer into symfony.

It relies in some aspects on ideas found in sfSmartyPlugin
([www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfSmartyPlugin][sfsmartyplugin]) but has been completely
re-written to fit the "new" [smarty 3 templating engine][smartylink].

**Warning No. 1**: This plugin has not yet been tested in a production environment. It
is a case study to give smarty 3 a chance, but during developement many
edge-cases occured which *in my opinion* proved that the smarty core has some
serious deficits in design so that is does not really fit into a
"modern web-mvc-framework" environment.

Please read this ([http://nosmarty.net/][nosmartylink]) for further information about that.

**Warning No. 2**: Smarty 3 is not yet officially released, currently the RC 1
version of Smarty 3 is beeing tested.

Feel free to use the plugin and modify it's code in any way, improve the symfony
helper integration, write own smarty-style helpers and so on,  in short: try
to have fun with smarty ;)

Smarty documentation and smarty 3 may be downloaded here: [www.smarty.net][smartylink]

Installation
------------

Install the plugin via symfony's build in [plugin:install task][plugininstalltaskdoc] or download a full
development sandbox from [github][github] ([http://github.com/joshiausdemwald/sfSmarty3Plugin][githubproject]).

    $ symfony plugin:install sfSmarty3Plugin

Configuration
-------------

The plugin is configured by an environment aware config/settings.yml and a
config/autoload.yml file which specifies the Smarty 3 library directory path.

In general you don't have to change this path unless you extract the Smarty3-files
into project_folder/lib/vendor/smarty.

To enable smarty to replace the original symfony PHP-view layer, you have to
create a module.yml configuration file in project_folder/apps/application_name/config/module.yml:

project_folder/apps/application_name/config/module.yml:
-------------------------------------------------------

    default:  # For all environments
      enabled:            true
      is_internal:        false
      view_class:         sfSmarty
      partial_view_class: sfSmarty

These few lines enable Smarty as a symfony templating engine. Note that all smarty
templates must end with ".tpl" instead of ".php", e.g. layout.php => layout.tpl,
_my_partial.php => my_partial.tpl, indexSuccess.php => indexSuccess.tpl and so on.

There is a fallback that automagically will use symfony's own sfPhpView class for
parsing templates that ends on ".php", so you are allowed to use both formats
parallel.

It is even possible to use plain php code within a smarty template by using
<?php ?> as a delimiter, thanks to smarty 3 "improvements" ;).

Use plugin/sfSmarty3Plugin/config/settings.yml to tweak your smarty3
configuration (respectively overwrite these settings in your
project_folder/apps/app_name/config/settings.yml). By doing so you are able
to define the default cache behaviour of smarty, for example.
